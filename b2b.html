    <!-- Chosen Palette: Warm Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA uses a dashboard-like, thematic structure. A sticky top navigation allows users to switch between a high-level 'Overview', the 'Methodology', and deep dives into four key 'Industries'. This non-linear approach was chosen for usability, allowing users to directly access the sections most relevant to them. The 'Overview' combines an interactive chart with key report stats for immediate impact. Each 'Industry' section uses an interactive card-based system to present publications, with click-to-reveal details. This structure transforms the dense report into a digestible, engaging, and user-driven exploratory experience rather than a linear document. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: 
        - Report Info: GDP contribution by sector for key APAC economies. -> Goal: Compare -> Viz: Interactive Doughnut Chart (Chart.js/Canvas) -> Interaction: Dropdown to select country, chart updates dynamically. -> Justification: Visualizes economic structure comparison effectively.
        - Report Info: Methodology criteria (Readership, Content Quality, etc.). -> Goal: Inform/Organize -> Viz: Icon-driven feature list (HTML/Tailwind) -> Interaction: Clickable icons to reveal detailed descriptions in a modal. -> Justification: Makes dense text engaging and less overwhelming.
        - Report Info: Detailed publication data (publisher, editors, focus). -> Goal: Organize/Explore -> Viz: Card-based layout (HTML/Tailwind) -> Interaction: Click card to open a modal with full details. -> Justification: Organizes a large amount of information cleanly, preventing cognitive overload and encouraging exploration.
        - Report Info: Key statistics (e.g., 60% global output, 73% trust in thought leadership). -> Goal: Inform -> Viz: Styled "Stat Blocks" (HTML/Tailwind). -> Interaction: None. -> Justification: Highlights crucial data points for quick consumption.
